# Description

## Starting point

Today’s freelancers are expected on top of their game at all times, juggling between being an expert in their domain and fully mastering the art of financial management.

More and more people choose to be freelancers and yet, managing one’s activity remains tough. The reason why is a deep lack of intuitive and simple financial tools. In particular, creating, editing, sending and managing quotes and invoices never come without struggles.

## The issue we tackle

How can freelancers financially manage their business smoothly while getting significant insights at a glance?

## Our vision : “go straight to the point”

We truly believe that running a business, as freelancers, should be easy as pie and straight to the point! Being alone to produce, build, cook and develop pulls out enough energy. There’s no need to add a financial conundrum at the end of the day! This shouldn't work to the detriment of private life. Hence, every freelancer should be able to go straight down to business through essential core insights in a click! What for? Be more productive and take effective decisions.

## Our mission

We want to be your business buddy and help you to focus on your activity. We’ll support you with daily time-consuming tasks while you run your business seamlessly and successfully!

## Monka ‘s Unique Selling Proposition
